      "speed": {
        "question": "What speed do I need?",
        "answer": "<b>100 Mbps:</b> Perfect for 1-2 people who browse, stream in HD, and work from home.<br /><b>250 Mbps:</b> Great for families with multiple devices streaming and gaming at the same time.<br /><b>500-1000 Mbps:</b> For the demanding user, large families, 4K streaming, gamers, and downloading large files."

      "broadbandType": {
        "question": "What is the difference between fixed and mobile broadband?",
        "answer": "<b>Fixed broadband</b> is tied to your address (usually via fiber or cable) and provides a stable, constant connection with unlimited data.<br /><b>Mobile broadband</b> uses the mobile network, making it portable. It's perfect on the go, but speed and stability can vary depending on coverage."
      },
      "security": {
        "question": "How do I protect my network and my router?",
        "answer": "<b>Change default passwords:</b> The first and most important step is to change both the router's administrator password and the name of your WiFi network (SSID).<br /><b>Create a guest network:</b> Most modern routers allow you to create a separate network for guests and smart devices (like speakers or vacuum cleaners). This isolates them from your private devices like computers and mobile phones.<br /><b>Be careful with links:</b> Never click on suspicious links in emails or messages, as they can give hackers access to your network."
